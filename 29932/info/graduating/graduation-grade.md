This page is based on the guidelines in effect as per the CAD meeting of 06/22/2016.

The graduation grade is decided by the Graduation Committee based on the final exam, the evaluators' judgment, and the candidate's curriculum. The grade is expressed out of 110 and is calculated as follows:

## Weighted Average

The weighted average of exam grades is expressed out of 110. The formula to calculate the weighted average is:

$$
\text{Weighted Average} = \frac{\sum (\text{Exam Grade} \times \text{CFU})}{\sum \text{CFU}}
$$

Where:
- \(\text{Exam Grade}\) is the grade obtained in each exam
- \(\text{CFU}\) is the number of European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System credits associated with each exam

## Increment for the Master's Degree in Computer Science

The maximum increment is 11 points. The Committee can add points to the weighted average according to the following criteria:

1. **Evaluation of the Internship Report**: from 0 to 9 points;
2. **Duration of the Study Program**: 1 additional point is assigned if the student graduates within 28 months after the enrolment date;
3. **Erasmus**: 1 additional point is assigned if the student participated in the Erasmus programme;

The official document can be found [here](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/calcolovotodilaurea-calculationfothedegreegrade_-_documenti_google_2_1_1.pdf).
## Part-Time Students

For part-time students, the criterion related to the legal duration of the program applies only if they were still within the legal duration at the time of choosing part-time status.

## Final Grade with Honors

The Committee may decide to award honors (110 cum laude) to recognize outstanding achievements. This decision must be unanimous by the Committee.

## Calculation Example

Suppose you have a weighted average of 98/110 and you meet the following criteria for the Master's Degree in Computer Science:

- Evaluation of the internship report: 8 points
- Graduation within 24 months: 1 points
- Participation in the Erasmus program: 1 point

Your graduation grade will be:

$$
98 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 108
$$

Your final grade will be 108. If you obtain 110 you won't be eligible for honors. In order to get honors you must obtain a score of at least 113.

We hope this information helps you understand how your graduation grade is calculated. Good luck!
