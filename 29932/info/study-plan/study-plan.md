You might have to check the webpage in case rules change, as it happened in the 2024/25 academic year when the recommended curriculums were added.

## Study Plan Basics

Students of the Master's Degree in Computer Science must submit a valid study plan ("percorso formativo") for approval to be able to book and take exams. A **study plan** defines the set of teachings a student plans to attend and complete during his/her first and second year.

A study plan for the Master Programme in Computer Science must comprise 120–123 credits, split as follows:
- 66 credits chosen from those offered within the course programme (with some restrictions, see below);
- 12–15 credits of elective teachings, chosen (in principle) from the entire Sapienza catalogue (must be justified to be approved, you can't simply insert Philosophy 3);
- 6 credits of a supplementary educational activity (in Italian: "Attività Formativa Complementare", in short "AFC"), which might be a seminary, a side project with a professor or a recognized work activity related to Computer Science (check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRMVE88DZffehZflMrOBiBL2YV40IZ5ZA-naM3d5cZm1Sws1NS9mXGXdrRw0L4a9yObgHgnlwHNQTG8/pub) for further information);
- 36 credits of Master thesis work and defense.

A study plan already in force can be revised by submitting for approval a new plan which includes all teachings whose exams have already been cleared.

## Submission and Revision Dates

You **can submit** your study plans **at most once per year** during the following period:
- **From October 1** of each year **until February 28** of the following year.

The **committee will evaluate** submitted plans periodically as follows:
- **Plans submitted by October 10** will be evaluated **by October 30**;
- **Plans submitted after October 10 and by November 30** will be evaluated **by December 31**;
- **Plans submitted after November 30 and by January 15** will be evaluated **by January 31**;
- **Plans submitted after January 15 and by February 28** will be evaluated **by March 31**.

**Study plans still pending evaluation cannot be changed**. For this reason, you are strongly advised to **submit** their study plans **only when you have a clear idea** about which teachings to attend, especially for their next academic year.

## How to Submit a Study Plan

Study plans must be submitted using the online submission system called **"Percorsi Formativi"**, accessible from within [Infostud](http://www.uniroma1.it/studenti).

## When and How does an Approved Study Plan Come into Effect?

Students whose study plans are approved will receive a notification to their **institutional email address**.

Study plans **come into effect starting from the Academic Year in which they were submitted** and **remain in effect until a new substitute study plan is** eventually submitted and **approved**.

{{% hint info %}}
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>
Study plans **approved between October and December will come into force from January 1** of the following year. This means that, **to take any exams in the session held from September to December** (which, in fact, belongs to the previous academic year), **the associated teachings must be part of a study plan approved in the previous academic year**.

The Infostud system forbids students from booking or taking any exam that is not included in their study plan currently in force.

The consequence of this rule is that **students without an approved study plan cannot book or take any exam**.

{{% hint warning %}}
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i> **Exams Ahead of Schedule**

Once your study plan is approved you can virtually book all the exams and finish your Master's Degree in one semester. In practice **if you book and pass an exam of a semester that you didn't attend yet, the administration might remove it from your career record**. The dangerous part is the "might" because if they notice right before your graduation, you might have to delay it; or, worse, if they notice it after you graduated they can legally invalidate your degree.

## What happens if a study plan is rejected?

Students whose study plans are rejected **will receive a notification to their institutional email address with the reasons for rejection** and further recommendations on how to correct the problem.

Such students **will need to submit a new study plan** by the deadlines mentioned above.

Their previously approved study plan (if any) will remain in force and can still be used to book and take exams

### **How to avoid rejection?**

Students are strongly advised to carefully read the "[**How to submit a valid study plan**](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science/study-plans/how-to-submit-a-valid-study-plan)" of the **guidelines and recommendations website managed by the course programme council**.

## Special Cases for Erasmus Programme

Students participating in the **Erasmus programme** may request assistance from the study plans evaluation committee for immediate changes to their study plan, should they encounter serious administrative problems at the hosting institution.

## Study Plan Options

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
The committee warmly recommends you to strictly follow the **recommendations and guidelines** in the [Study plans section of their dedicated website](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science) to neutralise the risk of your study plan being rejected.

**What follows is a purely introductory outline, devoid of many useful details.**
{{% /hint %}}

There are **two types** of study plans for the 2024/2025 academic year (you can check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kasq5efzmuVXt2SlMfGnvn1gUD5bD877/edit) for the appendices and PCCs combinations):

1. **Recommended Study Plan ("`PERCORSO FORMATIVO CONSIGLIATO`", Based on PCCs)**  
   Automatically approved if correctly compiled:
   - Choose **two specialization areas** (PCCs) according to your interests from the following list:
      - Algorithms
      - Artificial Intelligence
      - Computational Models for Systems Design
      - Data Science
      - Multimedia Computing and Interaction
      - Networks
      - Security
      - Software Engineering
      - Systems
   - Select all courses from the two chosen PCCs, as they're specified in "`ALLEGATO 3`";
   - Include related courses ("`Insegnamenti Affini`") taken exclusively from "`ALLEGATO 2`" until all CFUs (including free-choice ones) are completed;
   - Include an **AFC**;
   - In the study plan notes, include the phrase: "`PERCORSO CONSIGLIATO`", specifying the names of the two selected PCCs.

2. **Custom Study Plan ("`PERCORSO FORMATIVO INDIVIDUALE`")**  
   Must be reviewed by the Academic Committee:
   - Choose **54 CFUs** from **any core courses** listed in the PCCs ("`ALLEGATO 1`");
   - Add **12 CFUs** of related courses ("`Insegnamenti Affini`") taken exclusively from "`ALLEGATO 2`" and **12 CFUs** of free-choice courses, ensuring that all required CFUs are completed.
   - Include an **AFC**;
   - Include **justifications** in the study plan notes for deviating from the recommended PCC-based structure, adding the phrase: "`PERCORSO INDIVIDUALE`".

A recommended plan is highly encouraged as it guarantees automatic approval. Custom plans may require additional evaluation and are not guaranteed to be accepted.

## Contacts

You can open a support ticket on the [dedicated support page for the Master programme](https://support.mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/index.php) or have it automatically opened by sending an e-mail to: mastercs_studyplans@di.uniroma1.it. The committee invites students not to ask questions whose answers are already present in the [dedicated section of their website](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science/study-plans).

You will receive a response within about 30 days. Typically, the committee responds much faster when the study plan submission deadline approaches.
