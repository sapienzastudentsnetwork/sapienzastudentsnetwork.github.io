## Absence from Work for Study Reasons

A [form for absence from work for study reasons](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1etM2r6Of8Bh7KBR3n9KZ3gsmqoDHkNkB/view?usp=sharing) is available.

The **stamp** is **issued by the Educational Affairs Office**, via email ([segr.didattica@di.uniroma1.it](mailto:segr.didattica@di.uniroma1.it)), upon the student's request **and only if the professor’s signature is present**.

## Extraordinary Exam Sessions

The [self-certification form for working student status](https://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/field_file_allegati/autocertificazione_lavoratore.pdf) **for participation in extraordinary exam sessions** is available on the dedicated [student forms](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/modulistica-studenti) page.

In particular, the form can be completed by students who, for at least 60 days (even if not consecutive, but within the six months prior to submission), have carried out:
- **Paid and contract-based** work
- **Self-employment** (with or without a VAT number)
- **Entrepreneurial activities**
- **National civil volunteer** work

The form must be sent to the professor of the exam the student wishes to take and to the Administrative Office of the Faculty of Information Engineering, Computer Science, and Statistics ("I3S", segrstudenti.i3s@uniroma1.it) at least 20 days before the exam date.
