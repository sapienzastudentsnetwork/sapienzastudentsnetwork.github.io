Founded in 2016, [Sapienza Gladiators Racing Team](https://sapienzagladiators.it/) (SGRT) is the official team of Sapienza University of Rome competing in Moto Student, an international engineering competition involving universities from five continents, which requires the design, production, and development of a PreMoto3 prototype.

The championship is divided into the submission of several papers and concludes with a final event at the Aragón circuit. In the last edition, 80 teams from 19 countries around the world participated, split into the Petrol and Electric categories.

In 2018, during its first participation, SGRT won the Best Petrol Rookie Team award. In the 7th edition, SGRT placed 3rd in the final race, 3rd in the Best Moto Student Petrol ranking, and distinguished itself for the best Management Plan.

## Organization

The team consists of around 60 university students eager to put into practice what they learn during their studies by designing and creating a unique competitive motorcycle prototype.

Since the competition requires strong organization and revolves around various topics, the students are divided into 6 departments:

### Aerodynamics

The aerodynamics department focuses on studying solutions to improve the vehicle's stability and efficiency, optimizing speed by minimizing drag.

### Engine

This department is responsible for designing and optimizing the intake and exhaust systems with the goal of maximizing engine performance while fully complying with regulations. Every detail is meticulously studied to get the most out of the available power and ensure the prototype's exceptional reliability on the track.

### Electronics

This department is responsible for the design and integration of all the motorcycle's electronic and control systems, from the control units to the wiring, ensuring that each component is perfectly synchronized to enhance the prototype's drivability and performance.

### Vehicle Dynamics

The chassis department focuses on designing and optimizing the prototype's frame, ensuring it is robust, lightweight, and capable of providing perfect handling and stability on the track. The goal is to develop a geometry that allows the best use of components to guarantee high performance and precise riding in all conditions. Every detail is carefully studied, tested, and refined to achieve the ideal balance between performance and safety.

### Operations

The operations department handles logistics, organization, and administration, ensuring that every department works in synergy and meets deadlines. From seeking sponsors to managing the budget and purchases, the operations team ensures that nothing is left to chance and that everything runs like clockwork. Their work is essential to maintaining high efficiency and allowing the other departments to focus on innovation and technical development of the prototype.

### Marketing & Design

This department is responsible for all the team's communication and managing the image for the 2025 MotoStudent edition. It handles branding, creates graphic content, and promotes the project on social media, engaging sponsors and enthusiasts. It's not just about aesthetics and communication: the team also works on the prototype's design, ensuring that the motorcycle is not only functional and high-performing but also visually appealing, reflecting the spirit of #SGRT. Every detail, from colors to shapes, is designed to tell our story.

## How to Join the Team

The current edition of MotoStudent will conclude in October 2025 at the Aragón circuit, where we will present a new prototype with significant updates in terms of aerodynamics and power delivery.

Anyone (students, companies, individuals) who shares our dream and desire to grow together can race alongside us. The goal is to lead the Sapienza Gladiators Racing Team to victory!

Recruiting will begin after the conclusion of this edition, so we invite you to keep an eye on our social media and [our website](https://sapienzagladiators.it) for updates. See you on the track!
