# Erasmus

The Erasmus projects allows students to attend a period of mobility, that is attending part of your study plan in another university. During this period you can either take exams of your study plan or conduct research project for the thesis. Every bachelor degree allows to attend a **maximum of 12 months of mobility**; these 12 months can be used in more than one university - for example, attending six month in one university and other six month in another university the following academic year.

Sapienza offers two types of Erasmus:
- Erasmus+, that allows to attend a period of mobility of 2-12 months choosing between 500 universities in the European Union; among these universities you can find the 10 universities of the CIVIS project ([here](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/civis-universita-civica-europea) the list): due to specific agreements, mobility to these universities is integrated to make the conversion of exams easier; further information o the [Faculty site](https://i3s.web.uniroma1.it/en/erasmus-program)
- Erasmus Extra-UE, that allows to attend the mobility in universities outside the European Union; further information on the [Sapienza site](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina/bilateral-agreement-scholarships-non-eu-mobility)

At the moment no information is available on the call for the current year Erasmus project, but we intend to upload a guide for presenting the application when it will be possible.
