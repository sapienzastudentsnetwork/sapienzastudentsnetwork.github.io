The following information was taken from a [post on the university’s official Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUTO5qUjHFv):

* Exam tests are taking place as scheduled. Those who have already registered will sit the exam; the results will later be recorded on the Infostud platform.

* Those who are unable to register due to the unavailability of Infostud may still arrange their registration for the exam with the professor.

* The fundamental rules for the validity of the exam remain unchanged: inclusion in the study plan, compliance with any prerequisites, and regular payment of tuition fees (the first two instalments).
