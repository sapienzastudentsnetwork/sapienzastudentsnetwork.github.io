# Curriculum
There are many choices within the I3s department. If you choose a custom study plan you can explore many different subjects in Computer Science.
Technically you must choose at least 2 exams to be placed in the second year in order for the plan to be valid.
There's only a practical distinction between first and second semester courses, apart from the AFC and the final exam.
