Read the [Study plans section](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science/study-plans) of the programme website before submitting a plan. The Committee enforces the rules described there. Do **not** submit a tentative plan just to "reserve" exams — incomplete or poorly structured plans are often rejected.

## What is a study plan?

A **study plan** ("percorso formativo") is the formal list of teachings and activities you commit to for your Master’s degree. You must have an **approved** study plan in force to book and take exams via Infostud. Plans remain valid from the Academic Year of submission until a later approved replacement.

Target total: **120–123 CFU**, normally composed as:

- **54 CFU** — characterising courses (core);
- **12 CFU** — complementary courses;
- **12–15 CFU** — elective teachings;
- **6 CFU** — Additional Educational Activity (AEA / "AFC");
- **36 CFU** — Master thesis and defence.

See the [RCPs and Annexes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub) for the full course lists.

## Recommended Completion Paths (RCPs)

From 2023/24 onwards, the programme uses **RCPs** instead of curricula. Choosing two RCPs and following the recommended construction produces an **automatically accepted** plan.

Available RCPs (alphabetical):

- Algorithms;
- Artificial Intelligence;
- Computational Models for Systems Design;
- Data Science;
- Multimedia Computing and Interaction;
- Networks and Systems;
- Security;
- Software Engineering.

Each RCP has a defined set of characterising courses (see [Annex 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub)). Complementary courses are listed in [Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub).

## Two types of study plans

1. **Recommended Completion Plan (RCP)** — *automatic approval if correctly compiled*:
    - Choose **two** RCPs;
    - Include the courses of those RCPs (see [Annex 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub));
    - Use [Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub) to fill complementary and elective credits;
    - Add AEA (6 CFU) and thesis (36 CFU).

2. **Custom / Individual Plan (Percorso Formativo Individuale)** — *requires Committee review*:
    - Pick **54 CFU** from any RCP courses ([Annex 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub));
    - Add **12 CFU** complementary ([Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub)) and **12 CFU** electives;
    - Add AEA (6 CFU) and thesis (36 CFU).

For details and constraints, see [How to submit a valid study plan](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science/study-plans/how-to-submit-a-valid-study-plan).

## Building a valid plan

The Committee recommends a structured approach:

- **Step 1**: select two RCPs and include their characterising courses;
- **Step 2**: if <54 CFU, add other RCP courses;
- **Step 3**: if <66 CFU, add complementary courses ([Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS19hdnP4EeuQ5mgQDWU6G0uEIBN0oBcJ7RmGbsAu3Q00lsP8tFqa_TYiyzFuP2rg/pub));
- **Step 4**: add electives to reach 78–81 CFU. Avoid basic undergraduate courses and unjustified non-STEM electives;
- **Step 5**: add AEA (6 CFU) and thesis (36 CFU) → total 120–123 CFU;
- **Step 6**: assign courses to year 1 or year 2 (balanced load, 7–10 courses in year 1 is suggested);
- **Step 7**: submit via Infostud ("Percorsi Formativi") within the submission window.

For the complete official guidelines, see [How to submit a valid study plan](https://mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/master-programme-in-computer-science/study-plans/how-to-submit-a-valid-study-plan).

## Submission and evaluation

**Submission period:** October 1 – February 28 (max once per year).

**Evaluation schedule:**

| Submission date range       | Committee decision by |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| By October 10               | October 30             |
| October 11 – November 30    | December 31            |
| December 1 – January 15     | January 31             |
| January 16 – February 28    | March 31               |

**Note:** while under review, your plan **cannot** be edited.

## When a plan takes effect

- Valid starting from the Academic Year of submission;
- Plans approved **between October and December** apply **from January 1 of the following year** — important for booking exams in Sept–Dec sessions;
- Infostud blocks booking of exams not in the active plan.

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i> **Exams Ahead of Schedule**

Once your study plan is approved you can technically book all exams and even finish the Master's Degree in a single semester. In practice **if you book and pass an exam of a semester that you didn't attend yet, the administration might remove it from your career record**.

The dangerous part is the "might" because if they notice right **before your graduation, you might have to delay it**; or, worse, **if they notice it after you graduated they can legally invalidate your degree**.

## Rejection cases

**Rejection reasons:** basic electives, unjustified non-STEM courses, unbalanced yearly load, missing mandatory items, or overlapping content.

If rejected, you will get an email with reasons. Your previous approved plan (if any) stays valid. Correct and resubmit [within the same deadlines](#submission-and-evaluation).

## Erasmus exceptions

Students on Erasmus who face administrative issues at the host institution may request urgent adjustments. Contact the Committee with proof from the host university.
