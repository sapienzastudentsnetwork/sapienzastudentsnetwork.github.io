# Exercise and Solution Forums

One of the key focuses of the [Sapienza Students Network GitHub organization](https://github.sapienzastudents.net)
is the creation of repositories that serve as forums for exchanging solutions.

Leveraging READMEs, issues, or discussions, these spaces allow students to compare notes on exercises and past
exam papers, filling the gap left by the absence of official solutions from professors.

The Exercise and Solution Forums are open to new collaborators — every contribution, such as adding new exam
papers or exercises, is valuable for keeping individual forums up to date.

If you wish to take a more active role in their management, you can reach out to the
[respective current maintainers](https://github.com/sapienzastudentsnetwork#-gestori-repository-dellorganizzazione),
to Valerio **Fontana** ([@FeddyLix17](https://github.com/FeddyLix17)) [[Telegram](https://telegram.me/FeddyLix17)],
or to a [member of the Sapienza Students Network Executive Board](../contributing/sapienza-students-network/#-executive-board)
