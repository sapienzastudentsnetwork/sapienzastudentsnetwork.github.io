# Exercise and Solution Forums

One of the focuses of the [Sapienza Students Network GitHub organization](https://github.sapienzastudents.net) is the creation, through GitHub repositories, of forums *(built using a guiding README.md and the "discussions" feature)* for sharing and comparing solutions to exercises â€” including those taken from past exam papers â€” for university courses where no official solutions (authored by the course professors) are publicly available.

If you'd like to contribute - by starting new repositories for other courses or by managing or updating one of the existing Exercises and Solutions Forum repositories within the GitHub organization - either as a full member or externally, you can contact Matteo Collica ([@Matypist](https://telegram.me/Matypist)) on Telegram or send an email to [github@sapienzastudents.net](mailto:github@sapienzastudents.net).
Please include the username (or email address) of your GitHub account and (preferably) the username of your Telegram account, which can be listed as your contact reference for users who will access the repository ðŸ™‚
