## Third year

During the third year there is a compulsory course that allows you to complete computer training (Foundations of Computer Science).

Students then have the opportunity to choose in which direction to deepen their preparation, choosing three courses out of the Applied Computer Science group and one course out of the Law and Economics group.

The third year is completed by courses chosen by the student, of a maximum of 12 credits, which can also be chosen outside the educational offer of the course of study, as long as they contribute consistently to the completion of the training.

To complete their studies, students will have to carry out an internship and take an exam in front of the Commission for the final test.

The internship is carried out under the guidance of a manager within the Faculty and can be external (carried out in external companies or bodies) or internal (carried out as part of the degree course). In both cases, the internship requires the student to be presented with a real-world problem, which he or she will have to solve through the development of a project developed with a professional approach.

The methods of assessing the knowledge and skills acquired for individual aspects of training are based on ongoing assessments and/or final course exams, as well as through the evaluation of the documentation produced for projects and laboratory activities.

The verification of the overall preparation acquired during the course of studies takes place through the final test, which consists in the presentation of the internship activity carried out under the supervision of a teacher to the evaluation commission, which will be able to ask questions to ascertain the candidate's mastery of the work. of internship completed.
