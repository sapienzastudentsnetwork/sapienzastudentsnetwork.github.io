## Preselection (mandatory for non-EU applicants)

The [MoveIN](https://sapienza.gomovein.com/) pre-selection is a required preliminary assessment for non-EU candidates residing abroad and optional for Italian, EU candidates, and non-EU citizens residing in Italy. A positive outcome results in a pre-acceptance letter, inviting the candidate to proceed to the selection process. 

For non-EU citizens abroad, this allows them to submit a pre-enrolment application on [Universitaly](https://www.universitaly.it/) for a study visa by June 28, 2024. Registration details and timeframes for the MoveIN pre-selections are outlined at [this link](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions2024).

To be pre-selected for the degree programme, the following is required:

- A **high school diploma (or equivalent qualification)** obtained by the school year **2023-2024** and after no less than 12 years of study;
- Evidence of **adequate knowledge of the English language** according to the parameters indicated in [Annex E](https://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/field_file_allegati/14824_acsai_2024_25_en.pdf);
- **At least one of the admission tests** indicated in [Section 1](https://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/field_file_allegati/14824_acsai_2024_25_en.pdf) passed with a result of not less than 36/100.

Pre-selection alone **is not sufficient** for enrolment.
The following admission process depends on passing the selection.
Candidates from non-EU countries legally residing abroad cannot participate in the selection rounds without receiving the pre-acceptance letter and confirming the invitation it contains. For more details, click [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions2024).

## Visa

**Non-EU citizens must apply for a student visa** at the Italian Embassy or Consulate of their jurisdiction. Check if you need a student visa on the [Visa for Italy](https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en) portal.

If your application has been positively evaluated, the chosen institution will be able to issue a **Letter of eligibility for enrolment**. The competent Italian higher education institution will validate online your application with all the evaluation details required by the competent Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy to start your visa application.

Fill in the section **Visa** of the online form: once your request is approved by the Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy for the visa, you have to **take an appointment** and go to the Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy to obtain your visa.

The validation procedure done by higher education institutions **does not imply** any right to obtain the visa: the decision on visa for study purposes is of exclusive jurisdiction of the competent **Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy**.

If you are an EU citizen or come from EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), **you do not need a visa**. However, if stay in Italy for **more than 3 months**, you should **register with the Anagrafe (Register office) of your Municipality of residence**.
