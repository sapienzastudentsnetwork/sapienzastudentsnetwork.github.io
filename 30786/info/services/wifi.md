# University's WiFi

Sapienza offers two wireless networks to undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, professors and administrative staffers: Sapienza and Eduroam. Both allow a fast internet connection, but they are indeed very different.

## Sapienza Wi-Fi
**Sapienza Wi-Fi** uses an authentication system called Captive Portal:
1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network called "Sapienza";
2. A login window will automatically pop up;
3. Insert **your ID number (codice matricola)** and **the password you use for Infostud**.

After that, if all went well, you will be redirected to the homepage of Sapienza's website. If you reach that point, it means that you will be able to use the connection freely!

Keep in mind that Sapienza Wi-Fi requires login every time you try to connect to it, a not so practical feature if you have to use it frequently. Therefore, it is suggested to use Eduroam Wi-Fi, which requires only one configuration.

## Eduroam Wi-Fi
**Eduroam** (education roaming) is an international service of wireless roaming and it is, therefore, avaible in many academic institution around the world.
Crediantial for the access are **your personal Sapienza email (surname.id_number@studenti.uniroma1.it)** and **the password you use for Infostud**.

The Eduroam network is available in thousands of international universities! This means that, if you wanted to, you could go to another associated university and could connect to the Eduroam network using the same credentials of Sapienza!

## Which Wi-Fi should I use?
If you use Wi-Fi occasionally or you cannot configure Eduroam, it is better to use Sapienza Wi-Fi. Otherwise, Eduroam is the best option!
