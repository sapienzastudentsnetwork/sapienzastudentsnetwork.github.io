# Student's Opinions (OPIS)

The **student's opinions** (**OPIS**) are **anonymous surveys** over the quality of the teaching for each subject. They are **mandatory** for booking exams for a specific subject, and are analysed each year by a board of professors, which will use them for identifying problems and find solutions for them.

Each OPIS can be completed on InfoStud, by inserting an 8-characters (letters or numbers) string in the format `XXXXXXXX` (for instance, `MPDSXZSH` could be a plausible OPIS code). Mind that the OPIS for a certain subject can be completed **once per academic year**. Until the moment when it's not sent, all the data are saved as draft, and will be sent to Sapienza only when the student finishes the whole questionnaire.

## Structure of an OPIS survey

An OPIS survey is made of 7 sections, 6 of which are made of questions with multiple choice answers. The possible answers are:
 - Definitely yes;
 - More yes than no;
 - More no than yes;
 - Definitely not.

The last section contains two text sections for leaving any comment that you have, for a maximum of 300 characters.
