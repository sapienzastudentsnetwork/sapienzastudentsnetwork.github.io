# Exams

As every university, Sapienza asks its students to partake to the exams related to the courses that the students followed during the lecture semesters. Usually, exams are held during the exam sessions (check them [here](../Courses%20&%20Calendar/)).

An exam session is a time period of 7/8 weeks in which professors allow their students to take the exams related to their subject. Except for the exam session of September and the extraordinary sessions (find more about it [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/content/esami-di-profitto)), all the sessions allow the students to take the exam up to two times.

You can sit for an exam as many times you want, and there is no penalty for that, **as long as you haven't accepted your grade**.

{{< hint info >}}
**Q&A: When can I sit for an exam?**

Assume that you want to take the exam of Linear Algebra. You just started the course in the A.Y. 2024/25. The professor will communicate two dates on which you will be able to take the exam, (say for instance the 10/1/2025 and the 3/2/2025). You can take the exam either on the first or in the second date.

Suppose that, for any reason, you can't take it in the first exam session (so in the winter one): you will be able to sit for that exam in **any other** exam session to which you are allowed to participate (so either in the summer or September session, unless you made request for the extraordinary sessions. More info regarding them can be found below) **until you pass the exam**.

## Types of exams

There are many types of exams, and they mostly depend on the subject that you do: some may be **oral** (which consist in a discussion with the professor over the topics studied in the course), some may be **written** (which could consist on a theoretical exam or a practical one), others may be **practical** (for instance if you have to make a project), and some may blend these modes together.

Some exams may ask you to first take a written exam and then an oral one (if you pass a certain grade threshold, if you pass the written one, etc...). It all depends on the professor, there is no common rule.

Mind that each professor has its own way to do an exam, so **pay attention** to the modalities that will be explained at the beginning and at the end of the course. Most importantly, **before asking to the professor** for something that it may have already said, check the course page on Moodle / Classroom / whichever platform first, or ask your colleagues eventually.

You will be able to find more information regarding which kind of exams you'll find in each course page.

## How to book an exam

In order to reserve an exam, you must do it through **Infostud**, the official student platform made by Sapienza. You can find Infostud by going to the official Sapienza website ([uniroma1.it](https://www.uniroma1.it)) and navigating to the `Studenti`/`Students` section. There, you'll find two versions of Infostud: `Desktop` and `Mobile`. They both allow you to do the same things. If you are on a computer, you can freely open both versions, since they are responsive for desktops. If you are on a mobile, consider opening the mobile version, since is adapted for small, vertical devices.

{{< columns >}}

1. Go to the [uniroma1.it](https://www.uniroma1.it) website, and click on the `Studenti`/`Students` section;
<br><br>
2. Choose if you want to open the `Desktop` or `Mobile` version of Infostud. Depending on the one that you choose, click on the corresponding tab here below;
<br><br>
3. After clicking on any of the two versions of Infostud, you'll be brought to the SSO page for accessing any Sapienza service. There will be 3 options for logging in:
    - **Matricola**: you will be able to log in with your matricola and password;
    - **SPID**: log in through your SPID method;
    - **CIE**: log in with your Carta d'Identit√† (**CI**), the italian ID card.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Warning**

If you are italian or you have an italian CI, then **you must log in** with either the **SPID** or the **CIE** method.

The italian CI is not the same of the "Permesso di Soggiorno" (**PdS**, from here on) (the Staying Permit): if you have the PdS then you can access through your matricola.

**Q&A: InfoStud tells me that I have to complete the OPIS first. What do I do?**

If you didn't complete the OPIS before through a code that your professor shared in class, you will be asked to complete it. Once you'll do the OPIS, just repeat the procedures to book the exam. More infos about the OPIS can be found [here](../opis).
