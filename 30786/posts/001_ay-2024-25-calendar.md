Dear all,<br>
the summer exam session is coming to an end, but we already have some news for next year: we already have the new dates for the academic year 2024/25!

Here are listed the new dates for the two semesters and the three exam sessions (the winter, summer and September ones). The calendar will always be available [at this link](../../resources/calendar/).

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>23/9/2024 (Monday)</td>
        <td>20/12/2024 (Friday)</td>
        <td>1st Semester of lectures<br>
            <ul>

                <li><a href="third-year/#second-semester">3rd Year Schedule</a></li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3/6/2025 (Tuesday)</td>
        <td>25/7/2025 (Friday)</td>

    <tr>

        <td>23/9/2025 (Tuesday)</td>
        <td>Semptember Exam Session</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The dates for the extra exam sessions (to which you can apply only if you satisfy all the [necessary prerequisites](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/content/esami-di-profitto)) are the following:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>From...</th>
        <th>...to</th>
        <th>What</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>17/3/2025 (Monday)</td>
        <td>18/4/2025 (Friday)</td>
        <td>1st Extraordinary Exam Session</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8/10/2025 (Wednesday)</td>
        <td>6/11/2025 (Thursday)</td>
        <td>2nd Extraordinary Exam Session</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## TLDR
- the first semester's lectures will start the **23/9/2024** and will end the **20/12/2024**;
- the first exam session will start the **7/1/2025** and will end the **25/2/2025**.
