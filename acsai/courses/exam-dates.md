* exam sessions are taking place as scheduled;

* students who have already registered will sit the exam, and the results will later be officially recorded on the Infostud platform;

* students who are unable to register due to the unavailability of the platform may arrange their registration for the exam directly with the professor;

* the results of these exams will be recorded in a paper register held by the professor and only later uploaded to Infostud;

* the fundamental rules for the validity of the exam remain in force (consistency with the study programme, compliance with any prerequisites, and regular payment of tuition fees);

* as always, students must present a valid ID document at the exam.

To obtain information about upcoming exam sessions (date, time, and location), please contact or visit the following information points (one for each Faculty Department), or contact the professor directly by email.
