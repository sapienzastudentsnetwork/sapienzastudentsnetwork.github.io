# ACSAI Study Plan

{{% hint info %}}

<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i> Most of the information on this page has been sourced from the ["Study plan instructions" subpage](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/33502/attendance/instructions) of the [ACSAI course "Attendance" page in the Course Catalogue](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/33502/attendance).

## What is the Study Plan?

**In the third year** of the Bachelor of Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (ACSAI), students complete their education with only one compulsory course ‘Foundations of Computer Science' and others of their choice, according to certain rules. The set of examinations that a student intends to take during his or her degree is called a **Study Plan**, and on this page you will find some **instructions** and **advice** on how to complete yours and how to submit it to the committee for approval. **Without this procedure, within the prescribed timeframe, you would otherwise not be able to take the examinations of elective courses, only those mandatory for all.**

## How many Elective Courses should I choose?

Each student must choose **36 ECTS credits ("CFU")** of **elective courses**. For example, it is possible to choose 6 courses of 6 ECTS credits each or other combinations that total 36 ECTS credits, such as 2 courses of 6 ECTS credits each + 2 courses of 12 ECTS credits, and so on.

Of the **36 ECTS credits**:

- **18 ECTS credits** (**3** courses) must be chosen from the [Applied Computer Science course catalog](#applied-computer-science);

- **6 ECTS credits** (**1** course) must be chosen from the [Law and Economics course catalog](#law-and-economics);

- **12-15 ECTS credits** can be chosen from [outside the ACSAI course catalog](#how-to-select-external-courses), including from other departments (and faculties).

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i> **Warning**

- It is not allowed to select, as elective courses, exams that have already been passed within the same degree program, even if the course content was different;
- It is not permitted to choose courses from **Master's degree programs**, unless they are part of the **first three years** of a **single-cycle Master's program** (D.M. 270/04).

## When to Submit Your Study Plan

Students, once they reach the Third Year, can submit or request to renew their Study Plan only once per academic year.

The study plan can be submitted from **1 October each year until 30 September of the following year**.

The Committee will evaluate submitted study plans as follows:

| **Submission Period**       | **Evaluation Deadline** |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| October 1 – October 10      | By October 30           |
| October 11 – November 30    | By December 31          |
| December 1 – January 15     | By January 31           |
| January 16 – February 28    | By March 31             |
| March 1 – April 30          | By May 31               |
| May 1 – June 30             | By July 31              |
| July 1 – September 14       | **No evaluations**      |
| September 15 – September 30 | By October 31           |

## How to Submit or Renew Your Study Plan

Submitting a course of study takes place online via the Infostud system following the procedure described in the [**Student Handbook - SIAD - Study Plans**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vPLZKxIqgS1a4SItdhS6lj8OmdRfeIC/view?usp=sharing).

- The same procedure is used to renew the Study Plan, by submitting a new plan with modifications to the non-mandatory courses;

- It is not necessary to submit a new plan if no changes are desired.

If the student pre-selects a Curricular Study Plan (PFC) and chooses two courses included in the Degree Program in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence under the "Elective Courses," the Study Plan will be automatically approved.

The student will recognize this situation from the validation message, which will state: "The proposed Study Plan is correct and can be automatically approved."

In all other cases, students will need to wait for their Study Plan to be reviewed by a faculty member responsible for validation; this review will take place within a few weeks.

## How to select External Courses

**12 ECTS credits** of the Study Plan can be of courses outside the course manifesto, and thus from other **Bachelor's** Degree Programs (if desired also from other departments or even faculties), but **how to choose these teachings?**

{{% hint tip %}}
<i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: #238636;"></i> **12-15 ECTS credits**

In particular, it is possible to choose up to a maximum of **15 ECTS** of courses outside the Degree Program, which **will however be counted as a maximum of 12 ECTS**. This is to give you the possibility of choosing, for purely personal interest, one course outside the degree of 6 ECTS and another of 9, for example.
{{% /hint %}}

The choice of an external course must still be relevant to the Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Degree Program, meaning it must be a **course that can be useful for Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence training**.

- _For example, a Mathematics course might be useful for Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence training, but a Literature course is unlikely to be considered useful._

For assurance, students can ask the relevant [Academic Advisor](#academic-advisor) in the Competent Commission for the evaluation and approval of Study Plans whether the chosen course is relevant to the degree program. This can be done, for example, by sending an email with the course name, Degree Program, and Faculty where it is offered, explaining the choice of the course, and asking for confirmation about whether it can be included in their Study Plan.

- Keep in mind that **external courses chosen** are not always accepted; they are **often rejected** because they are similar to courses already included as mandatory in the degree program, or because they are not relevant.

Some courses that have been previously approved as external courses for ACSAI students in past years are listed in the section [External Elective Courses](#external-elective-courses).

## Academic Advisor

The **"Commission for the Evaluation and Approval of Study Plans"** is responsible for assessing and approving Study Plans within a few weeks.

{{% hint warning %}}
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i> **Students are advised not to write before two weeks after having submitted a Study Plan if it is not strictly necessary**. In the event of non-approval, students will receive appropriate communication regarding the changes needed to make the Study Plan compliant with the Study Plan regulations. A student may resubmit a new plan with the necessary corrections immediately after receiving the notification of non-approval.
{{% /hint %}}

The academic advisor on the Commission for the Bachelor's Degree is [Prof. Angelo Spognardi](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/en/docenti/spognardi-angelo), to whom you can write for further information and/or urgent approval requests (e.g., learning agreement for the Erasmus program).

## FAQ

{{% details "Can I choose only internal courses?" %}}

---

**Yes**, you can choose to take only courses within the Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence degree program (30786). However, you also have the option to include up to 12 ECTS credits from courses offered by other degree programs and faculties, if you prefer. This is not mandatory, but it is available as an option.

{{% /details %}}
<br>
{{% details "Can I choose all courses offered in the First Semester?" %}}

---

**Yes**, you are allowed to choose all courses offered in the First Semester. If you select two courses with overlapping timetables and plan to attend both, you will need to manage your time accordingly. There are no issues with regard to exams. You can freely choose to enroll in all courses from either the First Semester or the Second Semester.

{{% /details %}}
<br>
{{% details "What should I do if I choose a course that I don't like?" %}}

---

If **you have not yet submitted your Study Plan**, you can still modify your course choices. If you have already submitted your plan, you will need to wait until the next Academic Year to make any changes. In some cases, you may request an early modification to the <a href="#academic-advisor">academic advisor for the Study Plans</a>, subject to approval.
