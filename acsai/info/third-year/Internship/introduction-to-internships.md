## How the Internship Works

The internship is a fundamental step in your academic journey, as it allows you to put into practice the skills acquired during your degree program. It can be carried out at a company, an institution, or a research laboratory, and can be internal or external to the University.

The internship:
* **Internal**: carried out within the University, under the supervision of a professor or their research laboratory. During an internal internship, students may perform research, design, development, testing and evaluation of IT systems in various thematic areas.
* **External**: carried out at a company or external institution, under the supervision of a company tutor (External Supervisor) and a University professor (Internal Supervisor). During an external internship, students have the opportunity to apply the skills acquired during their studies, working on real projects and tackling challenges typical of the professional world.

The internship lasts 105 days, so it is very important to keep this duration in mind when choosing your graduation session.

## Which Internship Is Best for Me?

The choice between an internal or external internship depends on your preferences and academic path. Here are some considerations that may help you make the right choice:

* An **internal internship** allows you to enter the world of research, working on innovative projects and addressing topics related to all areas of computer science. If you are interested in continuing your studies or pursuing a PhD, an internal internship may be the best choice. The academic environment also offers more flexibility, especially in managing your time and study schedule.
* An **external internship** allows you to enter the job market right away, a context that is completely different from academia and that enables you to develop practical skills that may be useful in your future career. An external internship also gives you the opportunity to work on large-scale company projects, which can be an excellent opportunity to gain experience and build your professional path.

### How to Apply for the Internship (Internal)

Applying for an internal internship is a fairly simple process that requires a few steps:

1. Visit the professor's website to learn about their research area and any available internship/thesis proposals. If no information is available or if you already have a project idea, contact the professor directly to request information.
2. Contact the professor expressing your intention to carry out the internship with them. If they agree, define the project and internship details together.
3. Fill out the [internship assignment form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnCczF1MbtBDcJwEDtl1-RDry7SpLLmi/view?usp=drive_link), entering the internship topic agreed upon with the professor. The form must also be completed and signed by the supervising professor.
4. Fill out the [authorization form for the transfer of personal data to companies and institutions for placement purposes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1np8AtIhxw54oKr00Wh5B6Wx6XP0QRNkB/view?usp=sharing) (optional).
5. Fill out the [declaration of acknowledgment of the plagiarism guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBbTUEXgUl1zAaP1YL_nhXpIU7mxh5CQ/view?usp=sharing).
6. Download the transcript of exams from Infostud. To do this, log in to Infostud, select the "Certificates" button, and download the transcript of completed exams.
7. Submit the completed and signed forms, along with the transcript of exams, by filling out the [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/kzYh7zgvCvKHFnyA2).
