## How the Internship Works

The internship is a fundamental step in the academic journey, as it allows students to put into practice the skills acquired during the degree program. It can be carried out at a company, an organization, or a research laboratory, and can be either internal or external to the University.

The internship:
* **Internal**: It is carried out within the University, under the supervision of a professor or their research laboratory. During the internal internship, the student can engage in research, design, development, testing, and evaluation of computer systems in various thematic areas.
* **External**: It is carried out at a company or an external organization, under the supervision of a company tutor (External Supervisor) and a professor from the University (Internal Supervisor). During the external internship, the student will have the opportunity to apply the skills acquired during the degree program by working on real projects and tackling typical challenges of the professional world.

The internship lasts 105 days, so it is very important to take this duration into account when choosing the graduation session.

## Which Internship Is Best for Me?

The choice between an internal and external internship depends on your preferences and academic path. Here are some considerations that may help you make the right decision:

* An **internal internship** allows you to enter the world of research, working on innovative projects and tackling topics related to all areas of computer science. If you're interested in continuing your studies or pursuing a PhD, an internal internship could be the best choice for you. The academic environment also offers greater flexibility, especially in managing time and study.

* An **external internship** allows you to immediately enter the workforce, a completely different context from academia, where you can develop practical skills that may be useful in your future career. The external internship also gives you the opportunity to work on significant business projects, which could be a great chance to gain experience and build your career.

### How to Apply for the Internship (Internal)

Applying for an internal internship is a fairly simple process that requires a few steps:

1. Visit the professor's website to learn about their research area and any available internship/thesis projects. If no information is available on the website or if you already have a project idea, contact the professor directly for more details.
2. Reach out to the professor, expressing your intention to complete the internship with them. If they respond positively, agree on the project and internship details together.
3. Fill out the [internship assignment form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7nmsKWZpcw4MiMPf_Z6FDN3MMijxLjg/view?usp=sharing), including the internship topic agreed upon with the professor. The form must also be completed and signed by the professor supervising the internship.
4. Fill out the [authorisation form for the transfer of personal data to companies and institutions for placement purposes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Ujgdm4QnE_AFEIdvTU0MPmXR5LgTuIh/view?usp=sharing).
5. Complete the [declaration of acknowledgement of the guidelines on anti-plagiarism control](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hIkCi8PQZe9faZGZ00ZuqZtFVH8QeSHs/view?usp=sharing).
6. Download your transcript of records from Infostud. To do this, log into Infostud, select the "Certificates" button, and download the transcript of exams taken.
