## Why Use LaTeX?

For writing your internship report, we strongly recommend using LaTeX. LaTeX is a writing system particularly suitable for scientific documents, academic papers, and technical documents. It is widely used in academic settings for its ability to produce professional-looking documents, handle complex mathematical formulas, and automate the management of references and bibliography through [BibTeX](#bibliography-management).

LaTeX allows you to create your report more efficiently, letting you focus on the content while the system handles the formatting. It also provides a well-structured and easily modifiable document that will look professional and high quality.

### Overleaf and recommended template

To get started with LaTeX, we suggest using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), an online LaTeX editor that requires no installation on your computer. For your report, you can begin with this [template for the Sapienza bachelor’s thesis](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-sample-bachelors-thesis-for-sapienza-universita-di-roma/hknzgzrzbwwh). Although designed for a thesis, it can easily be used for an internship report.

#### Mathematical symbols

If you need to use mathematical symbols in your report, LaTeX allows you to insert them easily. For example, to write the set of real numbers, you can use the command `\mathbb{R}`. If you need a specific symbol, you can check this [list of mathematical symbols in LaTeX](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) to find the corresponding code.

### Length of the report

There is no mandatory length for the internship report. However, we recommend writing at least 30 pages. Remember that the quality of the content is more important than the number of pages, so focus on clarity and completeness.

### Bibliography management

To efficiently manage the bibliography, we suggest using BibTeX. This tool, integrated with LaTeX, simplifies the insertion and formatting of citations in your document.

### Final Tips

While writing your report, maintain a clear and professional writing style. Do not hesitate to use images, diagrams, or code snippets to illustrate your work when appropriate.

Before submitting the final version, ask your supervisor to review your report — they may provide valuable feedback and point out errors to correct.

Remember that the internship report is not just a graduation requirement, but also an opportunity to reflect on your educational journey and present your skills professionally. Take advantage of this opportunity to highlight your work and the competencies you developed during this important training experience.
