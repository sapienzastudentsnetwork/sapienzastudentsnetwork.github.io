# Help Us Improve the Degree Program

üìù The Computer Science Didactic Area Council ("CAD") has made a **questionnaire** available to gather information about
our study habits and the main challenges faced when taking exams. The data collected will help **improve student support**,
for instance by enhancing tutoring, practice sessions, or lab work. Through the questionnaire, you will also have the
opportunity to share **suggestions for improving the website** üòâ. **Thank you very much** in advance **for your contribution**!
